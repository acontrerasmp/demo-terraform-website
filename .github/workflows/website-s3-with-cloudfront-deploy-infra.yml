name: Deploy Next.js to S3 & CloudFront

#NOT TESTED YET, just a mock
# the idea is whenever a change to to app code is performed, the workflow will build the app, and redeploy the static assets to S3 and invalidate CloudFront cache
# in a second workflow the infrastructure will be deployed/updated if needed (not included here)
# using github environments to separate stg and prd deployments and also to ask for manual approval when deploying to prd
